                 – At this time the measures in place for the pandemic, have 
                 subsequently made service desks unavailable - you cannot get a 
                 marriage license in Ontario. Until further notice, any weddings 
                 planned for spring, summer and fall of 2020 should be considered 
                 postponed and replanned for a new date. I am terribly sorry to 
                 deliver this news, however I am still booking for winter and all of 2021.
                 <br><br>
                 In the meantime, I am available for virtual services such as vow renewal, 
                 baby blessings, life celebrations and more.

                    <p>Since childhood I've always felt the coolest job out there is being the person who marries folks. Spending time with people in the happiest parts of life, helping bring them together and leaving them to a new life as two become one... I mean what could possibly be better in terms of a career? </p>
                    <p>I have always had a passion for writing, language and communicating. I love public speaking. I love learning. Although these are all skills I greatly possess - there is nothing I love more than helping clients get exactly what they want!</p>
                    <p>In the past I have been a sex educator, a personal trainer, and barber. All these careers have taught me how to listen, clarify what my clients want, and how to get them precisely what they are looking for. Not to mention how open-minded these paths have also taught me to be. These past careers have groomed me (pun intended) to be the best at personalized customer service, tailoring to exactly what my clients have hoped for.</p>

            <h2>I would be honoured to bring your love together as a legally married couple.</h2>
            <p>I believe that the brand of love each couple shares is unique and its expression of union should be too. I want to help create the ceremony you have dreamed of. As personalized as it gets and edited by the absolute best – you. This is your ceremony and what I create with you will be as special, romantic, silly, warm, fun, or wild as you have always envisioned.</p>
