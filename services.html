            <h2>A unique experience, tailored to your love</h2>
            <p>As a Life Cycle Celebrant, I have been trained and educated on creating personalized wedding ceremonies. I spend some time with you as a couple and you provide me some information that I draw from. I will create a narrative about your love, fully decked in unifying rituals that you choose and approve. I am here to make the ceremony custom and personalized to you and the love you and your partner share. Love is unique. Your love deserves to be shared uniquely.</p>
            <h3>Created by me, perfected by you</h3>
            <p>The entire ceremony I write is edited by you. I can write and execute the whole ceremony. If you would like to write your own vows, I am able to edit them for you. I am able to write vows if needed.</p>

            <h2>Marriage Ceremony</h2>
            <h3>Your love. Your day. Your ceremony.</h3>
            <p>Marriage is a special union of individual, unique people. Your ceremony deserves to be as unique as you are, and each element of your ceremony should be a reflection of your love. It’s your story;  it may be as long or short as you want it to be, involving as many or few elements you love. What you want is what we make happen, together.</p>
            <p>Together, we create a place in time for your romance story to be honoured, shared and unified.</p>

            <h2>Elopement</h2>
            <h3>No ceremony, no problem!</h3>
            <p>For some, eloping means sharing your special union intimately and quietly between yourselves and your closest friends. Maybe you want the experience to be in your home or at the place you first met. For others, eloping means meeting at the airport quickly before taking off to a honeymoon!</p>
            <p>However you choose, we will make your elopement exactly the way you want it.</p>
            <p>Please note that two witnesses are still legally required.</p>

            <h2>Fees</h2>
            <p>Due to the nature of custom and personalized services for each unique couple, there are no standard fees. My fees are in accordance with the standard of the geographical area.</p>
            <p>I aim to create your vision within your budget as best as possible. After an initial discussion about the desired services, I will conduct a review  of what is required, and within 48 hours you will be provided with a quote for your ceremony.</p>
            <p>If you decide I am the right person to officiate your love, we will then discuss the deposit and due date of the full payment.</p>
