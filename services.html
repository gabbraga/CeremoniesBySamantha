            â€“ At this time the measures in place for the pandemic, have
            subsequently made service desks unavailable - you cannot get a
            marriage license in Ontario. Until further notice, any weddings
            planned for spring, summer and fall of 2020 should be considered
            postponed and replanned for a new date. I am terribly sorry to
            deliver this news, however I am still booking for winter and all of 2021.
            <br><br>
            In the meantime, I am available for virtual services such as vow renewal,
            baby blessings, life celebrations and more.
