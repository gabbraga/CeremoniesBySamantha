            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		  <p>What is a Life Cycle Celebrant?</p>
		  <p>I believe that the brand of love each couple shares is unique and its expression of union should be too. I want your ceremony to be everything you have ever fantasized about. I aim to decipher all the info you want to share with me to create the best ceremony for you. As personalized as it gets and edited by the absolute best â€“ you. This is your ceremony and what I create with you will be as special, romantic, warm, fun, or (and) wild as you have always envisioned.</p>
		  <p>Where do I perform services?</p>
		  <p>I am able to solemnize your union in Eastern Ontario and Quebec.</p>
		  <p>What do I do?</p>
		  <p>I am a certified wedding officiant educated in ceremony and ritual. I customize the solemnizing of unions of weddings, vow renewals, and elopement. I write beautiful, unique ceremonies based on information you share with me about your relationship. Whatever you have in mind, I will figure out how to make it a reality for your big day!

				Though I currently only offer marrital services, I will be continuing my education and adding all the life cycle certificates to my skills and services. </p>
		  <p>What don't I do?</p>
		  <p>I am not a religious official, though I am still able to include a prayer or special blessing in your ceremony. If you have anything you wish to include, let me know!</p>
		  <p>What am I open to?</p>
		  <p>With a wide open mind, I would love to be part of some crazy things in my career! If you are looking for a drag, cosplay, nudist, or skydive wedding, or something else on the tabooer side of life, give me a call! I would love to help the mildest to wildest of folks!</p>
