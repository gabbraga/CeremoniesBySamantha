            – At this time the measures in place for the pandemic, have
            subsequently made service desks unavailable - you cannot get a
            marriage license in Ontario. Until further notice, any weddings
            planned for spring, summer and fall of 2020 should be considered
            postponed and replanned for a new date. I am terribly sorry to
            deliver this news, however I am still booking for winter and all of 2021.
            <br><br>
            In the meantime, I am available for virtual services such as vow renewal,
            baby blessings, life celebrations and more.

            <p>Because it's your story, we can make it as long or as short as you want. The vows you speak can be
                classic or custom, written by you or me. We can involve as many or as few elements as you wish.</p>
