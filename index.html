            <h2>What is a Life Cycle Celebrant?</h2>
            <p>I studied at the International Life Cycle Celebrant Institute. We are educated in ceremony and ritual. We learn how to write and customize ceremonies for people across all the cycles that life goes through. Sworn to adhere to a code of ethics where we accept everyone for who they are and what they want in their ceremony!</p>
            <p>Though I currently only offer marrital services, I will be continuing my education and adding all the life cycle certificates to my skills and services.</p>
