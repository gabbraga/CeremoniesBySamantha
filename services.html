            <h2>A unique experience, tailored to your love</h2>
            <p>As a Life Cycle Celebrant, I have been trained and educated on creating personalized wedding ceremonies. I spend some time with you as a couple and you provide me some information that I draw from. I will create a narrative about your love, fully decked in unifying rituals that you choose and approve. I am here to make the ceremony custom and personalized to you and the love you and your partner share. Love is unique. Your love deserves to be shared uniquely.</p>
            <h3>Created by me, perfected by you</h3>
            <p>The entire ceremony I write is edited by you. I can write and execute the whole ceremony. If you would like to write your own vows, I am able to edit them for you. I am able to write vows if needed.</p>

            <h2>Marriage Ceremony</h2>
            <h3>Every love is unique. Your love deserves to be shared uniquely.</h3>
            <p>As a Life Cycle Celebrant, I have been trained in the art of creating personalized, custom ceremonies.</p>
            <p>With the information you provide me, I create a narrative about your love, fully decked in unifiying rituals that you choose and approve. Together, we build a place in time for your romance story to be honoured, shared and unified. Because its your story we can make it as long or as short as you want. The vows you speak can be classic or custom, written by you or me. We can involve as many or as a little elements as you wish! This is your love. Your day. Your way! What you want is what we make happen!</p>
            <p>Some examples of ritual elements commonly included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Handfasting</li>
                <li>Unity candle</li>
                <li>Sand blending</li>
                <li>Garland exchange</li>
                <li>Readings by a friend or family member</li>
                <li>And so much more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cross cultural is widely sought and I am happy to bring cultural elements from your background, so long as they are not of a religious nature that would be reserved for religious clergy.</p>

            <h2>Eloping</h2>
            <h3>Planning to keep things quiet and take off to your honey moon?</h3>
            <p>I offer a no fuss, no ceremony eloping service.</p>
            <p>Like every marriage, you will still need 2 witnesses.</p>
            <p>We can meet at your home, a coffee shop or even the airport for an authentic eloping! Quick and easy.</p>
            <p>Please note that elopings still require the couple to get the obligatory paper work from their municipality or province and that I do not offer eloping services on Fridays or Saturdays.</p>

            <h2>Prices</h2>
            <p>Due to the unique nature of customized work, I am unable to have a standard price list.</p>
            <p>Upon the initial no obligation meeting, I will review what you're seeking and give you a proper price based on your specific needs and wants.</p>
            <p>I aim to create your vision within your budget as best as possible, and am happy to offer suggestions to keep things affordable.</p>
            <p>Thank you for considering me as your officiant. It is my greatest honour to solemnize your love, your way.</p>
