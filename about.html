        <section class="about">
            <p>Since childhood I've always felt the coolest job out there is being the person who marries folks. Spending time with people in the happiest parts of life, helping bring them together and leaving them to a new life as two become one... I mean what could possibly be better in terms of a career? </p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for writing, language and communicating. I love public speaking. I love learning. Although these are all skills I greatly possess - there is nothing I love more than helping clients get exactly what they want!</p>
            <p>In the past I have been a sex educator, a personal trainer and a barber. All these careers have taught me how to listen, how to clarify what my clients need and want, and how to be a friend in a time when life is changing. I can’t neglect to mention how open minded they have also taught me to be. These past careers have groomed me (no pun intended) to be the best at custom customer service person, tailoring to exactly what my clients are seeking.</p>

            <h2>I would be honoured to bring your love together as a legally married couple.</h2>
            <p>I believe that the brand of love each couple shares is unique and its expression of union should be too. I want your ceremony to be everything you have ever fantasized about. I aim to decipher all the info you want to share with me to create the best ceremony for you. As personalized as it gets and edited by the absolute best – you. This is your ceremony and what I create with you will be as special, romantic, warm, fun, or (and) wild as you have always envisioned.</p>
