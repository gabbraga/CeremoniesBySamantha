I spend some time with you as a couple and you provide me some information that I draw from. I will create a narrative about your love, fully decked in unifying rituals that you choose and approve.

                <p>The entire ceremony I write is edited by you. I can write and execute the whole ceremony. If you would like to write your own vows, I am able to edit them for you. I am able to write vows if needed.</p>
