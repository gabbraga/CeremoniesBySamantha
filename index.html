            <h2>What is a Life Cycle Celebrant?</h2>
            <p>I studied at the International Life Cycle Celebrant Institute. We are educated in ceremony and ritual. We learn how to write and customize ceremonies for people across all the cycles that life goes through. Sworn to adhere to a code of ethics where we accept everyone for who they are and what they want in their ceremony!</p>
            <p>Though I currently only offer marrital services, I will be continuing my education and adding all the life cycle certificates to my skills and services.</p>

            <h3>Where do you perform services?</h3>
            <p>I am able to solemnize your union in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec.</p>
            <h3>We want a religious ceremony, what are you able to do?</h3>
            <p><strong>I am not a religious official</strong>, though I am able to help include a prayer or special blessing in your ceremony. If you have anything you wish to include, let me know!</p>
            <h3>We have some crazy ideas... are you up to it!?</h3>
            <p>With a wide open mind, I would love to be part of some crazy things in my career! If you are looking for a drag, cosplay, nudist, or skydive wedding, or something else on the tabooer side of life, give me a call! I would love to help the mildest to wildest of folks!</p>
